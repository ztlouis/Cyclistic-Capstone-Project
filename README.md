# Cyclistic-Capstone-Project
Capstone project of Google Data Analytics course on Coursera

I have recently completed the Google Data Analytics course on Coursera as one of my first experiences with Data Analytics, and I will be showcasing what I have learnt in the form of a capstone project.
We will be working on a problem for Cyclistic, a fictional bike sharing company based in Chicago. 

## Background of Cyclistic
Cyclistic is a fictional bike sharing company based in Chicago. They have a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day. \

Cyclistic's current market strategy relies on building general awareness and appealing to broad customer segments. To do this, they have flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders, while those who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers,
management believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, they believe there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. 


## Scenario
I play the role of a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, we will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### Ask
The question I will be working on is 'How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?'  


### Prepare
Firstly I obtained the datasets of the latest 12 months (Jun 24 - May 25) from [this link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). \
